#  Social Media Addiction Prediction

> An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts social media addiction risk level and explains the result — deployed as an interactive web application.

---

##  Project Overview

This project classifies social media users into 4 addiction risk levels — **Low, Moderate, High, Severe** — based on 13 behavioral and psychological features. The model is deployed as an interactive web app where a user fills in their habits and immediately receives their risk level with a SHAP-powered explanation of what's driving the prediction.

**What makes this project different from a standard Kaggle notebook:**
- Full data cleaning pipeline on a deliberately messy raw dataset
- 5 ML models trained, cross-validated, and compared with MLflow experiment tracking
- SHAP explainability — the model explains every individual prediction
- Deployed live on Streamlit Cloud — accessible by anyone, anywhere

##  Model Results

| Model | Test Accuracy | Cross-Val (5-fold) | CV Std |
|---|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | 96.94% | 95.53% | ± 0.91% |
| **Decision Tree** ⭐ | **99.49%** | **98.73%** | ± 1.07% |
| Random Forest | 99.49% | 99.24% | ± 0.74% |
| SVM | 96.43% | 95.66% | ± 2.27% |
| KNN | 91.33% | 89.28% | ± 1.74% |

**Best model: Decision Tree** — 99.49% accuracy, validated across 5 folds.

> **Note:** High accuracy is expected on this dataset as it was generated with clear behavioral rules. In a real-world clinical dataset, 75–85% would be more typical. The pipeline, explainability layer, and deployment are the transferable components.

### MLflow Experiment Tracking

All 5 model runs are tracked with MLflow — accuracy, cross-validation mean, and standard deviation logged per run.

##  Dataset

**980 clean rows** · **15 columns** · **4 balanced classes** (245 per category)

| Feature | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Age` | Numeric | User age (13–60) |
| `Gender` | Categorical | Male / Female / Non-Binary |
| `Platform` | Categorical | Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc. |
| `Daily_Usage_Time_min` | Numeric | Minutes spent daily on social media |
| `Posts_Per_Day` | Numeric | Posts published per day |
| `Likes_Received_Daily` | Numeric | Daily likes received |
| `Comments_Received_Daily` | Numeric | Daily comments received |
| `Messages_Sent_Daily` | Numeric | Daily messages sent |
| `Scroll_Rate_ppm` | Numeric | Scrolling speed (pages per minute) |
| `FOMO_Score` | Numeric | Fear of Missing Out (1–10) |
| `Mental_Health_Index` | Numeric | Mental health score (20–100) |
| `Productivity_Loss_Score` | Numeric | Self-reported productivity loss (1–10) |
| `Emotional_State_Post_Usage` | Categorical | Mood after using social media |
| **`Addiction_Level`** | **Target** | **LOW / MODERATE / HIGH / SEVERE** |

---

##  Data Cleaning Pipeline (`cleaning.py`)

The raw dataset contains real-world quality issues handled step by step:

| Issue | Count | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Missing numeric values | ~80 per column | Filled with **median** |
| Missing categorical values | ~63 per column | Filled with **mode** |
| Missing target values | 5 rows | **Dropped** |
| Duplicate rows | 20 | **Removed** |
| Impossible values (usage = -30 or 9999 min) | 15 rows | **Filtered** [0, 1440] |
| Inconsistent casing (`male`, `MALE`, `Male`, `M`) | Many | Normalized to **UPPERCASE** |

**Result:** 1020 raw rows → **980 clean rows**, 0 missing values, 0 duplicates.

##  SHAP Explainability

The model doesn't just predict — it explains. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) calculates how much each input feature pushed a prediction toward or away from each risk level.

**Example:** For a MODERATE prediction:
- `Productivity_Loss_Score` → strong positive push (increases risk)
- `Daily_Usage_Time_min` → moderate positive push (increases risk)
- `Mental_Health_Index` → negative push (reduces risk)

##  Streamlit App (`app.py`)

The web app has 3 sections:

**Sidebar** → 13 sliders and dropdowns for user habits (age, platform, daily usage, FOMO score, etc.)

**Left panel** → Color-coded risk card with confidence percentage + probability breakdown per class:
- 🟢 LOW · 🟡 MODERATE · 🟠 HIGH · 🔴 SEVERE

**Right panel** → SHAP bar chart showing top 10 features that influenced the prediction, with direction (red = increases risk, blue = reduces risk)

##  What I Learned

- How to build a **complete supervised ML pipeline** from raw messy data to deployed app
- Why **cross-validation** is more reliable than a single train/test split
- How **SHAP** turns a black-box model into an interpretable tool
- Why **`stratify=y`** matters in multi-class problems
- How **MLflow** tracks experiments so you never lose a result
- How to deploy a Python app publicly for free with **Streamlit Cloud**

##  Possible Next Steps

- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`
- [ ] Fairness analysis across gender and age groups
- [ ] Collect real Screen Time export data from volunteers
- [ ] Add ROC curves per class
